The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft to be made. To accomplish this, engineers did something very unconventional while making the aircraft. The difference is obvious in this image of the 787 alongside the 737. An interesting consequence of this difference is that the 787 has special equipment to handle lightning strikes.

What major innovation did engineers come up with while making the 787?

### The 787's fuselage and wings are made of Carbon Fibre Composites

Since carbon fibre doesn't conduct electricity (unlike aluminium), the 787 needed special lightning protection gear

Pictured below are *Spilomyia longicornis* and a vespid wasp. *S. longicornis* mimics the vespid wasp as a defense mechanism as vespid wasps have a string.

However, this mimicry is not perfect and the two can be easily distinguished. What are these two notable features that the *S. longicornis* doesn't mimic?

To make one of these differences less apparent, *S. longicornis* have come up with a rather dumb but effective strategy. What is this strategy?

**X** is an american term for _a report, project, or anything else presented in a flashy way with little (or sometimes misleading) substance_. **X** is a cultural art form, but it acquired this derogatory meaning after drawn out peace-time treaty negotiations between the United States and Japan which had extended to 1960, and because Japan, in an effort "to shed its image as a global marauder" sent **X** to the U.S. after World War II to sow the seeds of goodwill.

In business, **X** has now become *genericised*, that is, the brand or company **X** is now synonymous with a certain action, such as 'googling' for search engines and 'combiflam' for paracetamol/ibuprofen.

Airbus engineers used the CAD package **C** to design the airplane **X**. Due to versioning differences between **C** (the older versions’ saved files were incompatible with the newer version, and needed a converter), the wires running along the fuselage of **X** were too short when the fuselage was assembled. As a result, Airbus faced heavy losses and delays in the production of **X**, and had to rework the design.

It has won Several awards for it’s design and energy efficiency.

**X** optimization is a heuristic method of finding the shortest path in a graph. In this method, _agents_ are made, which are made to travel back and forth between the source and the target node, and the agents secrete _pheromones_ whenever they travel. The pheromones are not constant, and would continuously evaporate with time. Agents also prefer the path with more pheromones.

As a result, the shortest path would have the maximum concentration of pheromones, since the pheromones would evaporate the least along this path (because of short travel time and high frequency of agents).

ID **X**, the common name of this family of algorithms.

**X** cutting or **X** partitioning is a type of cutting/partitioning in which only _edge to edge cuts_ are allowed (cuts that go from one edge of the polygon to the other). This method has applications in glass cutting, where large sheets of glass need to be cut into smaller sizes using edge to edge cuts, and also in designing floorplans in microelectronics. **X** is aptly named after a tool that could only make edge to edge cuts, and not intermediate cuts.

An **X** protocol, sometimes also called a **Y** protocol, refers to a broad class of algorithms or protocols which propagate information in a distributed network. The main structure of any such algorithm is as follows:

1. With some given frequency, each machine picks some other machine at random and shares some information.
2. The information shared in each interaction is of a bounded length.
3. The communication need not be reliable in every interaction.

Find **X** or **Y**. **X** being something that many people show disdain for but often end up participating in, while **Y** is something that all of us have heard more than enough of in recent times.

### X = Gossip, Y = Epidemic

Its Wikipedia entry is pretty fun,

*"Each employee pairs off with another, chosen at random, and shares the latest gossip. At the start of the day, Dave starts a new rumor: he comments to Bob that he believes that Charlie dyes his mustache. At the next meeting, Bob tells Alice, while Dave repeats the idea to Eve. After each water cooler rendezvous, the number of individuals who have heard the rumor roughly doubles (though this doesn't account for gossiping twice to the same person; perhaps Dave tries to tell the story to Frank, only to find that Frank already heard it from Alice)."*
