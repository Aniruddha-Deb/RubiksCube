The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is one of the most fuel-efficient aircraft to be made. To accomplish this, engineers did something very unconventional while making the aircraft. The difference is obvious in this image of the 787 alongside the 737. An interesting consequence of this difference is that the 787 has special equipment to handle lightning strikes.

What major innovation did engineers come up with while making the 787?

### The 787's fuselage and wings are made of Carbon Fibre Composites

Since carbon fibre doesn't conduct electricity (unlike aluminium), the 787 needed special lightning protection gear

The following widely-used theorem in probability and statistics has an apt name: in spite of the very rigorous proof involved for this theorem, the formulation of this theorem is very intuitive, and resembles something that a statistician would do _in his sleep_. 

What is the apt name given to this theorem?

One of the most iconic scenes in sci-tech films, **X** was actually made from characters scanned from Japanese sushi cookbooks, which explains the character composition. Sound designer DA Davis digitized raindrops against window panes to create the sound effects as X plays. X is now a hallmark of digital tech and hacker culture, and is eponymous with the movie in which it was used, similar to Star Wars' opening crawl.

ID X.

Pictured below are *Spilomyia longicornis* and a vespid wasp. *S. longicornis* mimics the vespid wasp as a defense mechanism as vespid wasps have a string.

However, this mimicry is not perfect and the two can be easily distinguished. What are these two notable features that the *S. longicornis* doesn't mimic?

To make one of these differences less apparent, *S. longicornis* have come up with a rather dumb but effective strategy. What is this strategy?

-------------------

Unlike the vespid wasps, they do not have a wasp waist and long black antennaes on their head.

To make the lack of antennae less apparent, they wave their front legs above their heads.

In business, **X** has now become *genericised*, that is, the brand or company X is now synonymous with a certain action, such as 'googling' for search engines and 'combiflam' for paracetamol/ibuprofen. This is strange, as X is neither relevant nor holds significant market share in the industry in which it is currently genericised (they hold around 25% in a very competitive market). 

X used to have a monopoly on the business, but they suffered a slow and painful decline, and in tech circles X is more popular for several other things, other than their main business.

It's absurd for a program to have superpowers, but the siblings X and Y have an easter egg, if not a superpower. When asked, X claims to have the Z superpower, whereas Y doesn't. As a result, when prompted for an easter egg, Y has a very different response when compared to X.

ID X, Y, Z (3,3,4 split). Bonus points (+5) for explaining Y's easter egg, *only if* you get all of X, Y and Z.

<img src="img/moo_q.png" class="q-img q-img-centered">

-------------------

## X = `apt-get`, Y = `aptitude` and Z = Super-Cow powers

`apt-get` (advanced packaging tool) has **super-cow powers**, whereas aptitude does not. If you're on a debian-based machine, typing out `apt-get --help | grep -i cow` would tell you.

*Bonus*: The easter egg is an elephant being eaten by a snake (from The Little Prince)

Airbus engineers used the CAD package **C** to design the airplane **X**. Due to versioning differences between **C** (the older versions’ saved files were incompatible with the newer version, and needed a converter), the wires running along the fuselage of **X** were too short when the fuselage was assembled. As a result, Airbus faced heavy losses and delays in the production of **X**, and had to rework the design.

ID **C**, an industry-prevalent tool for aircraft modelling due to it’s ability to handle splines and smooth surfaces, and **X**, the aircraft Airbus was building with **C**.

-------------------

## C = CATiA, X = Airbus A380

CATiA v4 and CATiA v5 had major compatibility issues, and this bogged down development of the A380

_Biomimetic architecture_ is a type of architecture that takes inspiration from nature for efficient design ideas. An iconic skyscraper, inspired from the design of the venus flower basket sponge (pictured below) is an example of the great success of this type of architecture. The skyscraper incorporates energy-saving methods which allow it to use only half the power that a similar tower would typically consume. It has won Several awards for it’s design and energy efficiency.

Identify the skyscraper in question.

*Rät* is a viral 2020 song about the disillusionment of the younger generation from the Silicon Valley. Following is an excerpt from the same.
<p style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">
So fuck your tunnels, fuck your cars, fuck your rockets, fuck your cars again<br />
You promised you'd be Tesla, but you're just another Edison<br />
'Cause Tesla broke a patent, all you ever broke were hearts<br />
I can't believe you tore humanity apart<br />
With the very same machines that could have been our brand new start<br />

The original name of the song was longer, consisting of two words, referencing a meme. The final name, Rät, is a shortened version of the same.

**X** optimization is a heuristic method of finding the shortest path in a graph. In this method, _agents_ are made, which are made to travel back and forth between the source and the target node, and the agents secrete _pheromones_ whenever they travel. The pheromones are not constant, and would continuously evaporate with time. Agents also prefer the path with more pheromones.

As a result, the shortest path would have the maximum concentration of pheromones, since the pheromones would evaporate the least along this path (because of short travel time and high frequency of agents).

ID **X**, the common name of this family of algorithms.

_agents_ are simply ants, which secrete pheromones

**X** cutting or **X** partitioning is a type of cutting/partitioning in which only _edge to edge cuts_ are allowed (cuts that go from one edge of the polygon to the other). This method has applications in glass cutting, where large sheets of glass need to be cut into smaller sizes using edge to edge cuts, and also in designing floorplans in microelectronics. X is aptly named after a tool that could only make edge to edge cuts, and not intermediate cuts.

ID **X**.
