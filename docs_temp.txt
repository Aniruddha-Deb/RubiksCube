qcode is supposed to be a one, two or three character string containing 
the colors of the question. No association with question topics yet. The
colors are:

R: Red
G: Green
W: White
Y: Yellow
B: Blue
O: Orange

so an orange and blue edge would be OB or BO, and a white-orange-blue edge
would be WOB or WBO or BOW or any of the 6 combinations. This will be taken
care of in the loader (which would search for a string with all permutations)

Remember that qcodes are completely initialization dependent, and will 
work with both a western and a japanese color scheme on the cube. For 
this quiz however, we're going with a western color scheme, so the color
scheme is:

  B
O W R Y
  G 

Blue-Green, Orange-Red and White-Yellow are the opposite sides, so a 
white-yellow edge, or a blue-green-white corner are impossible.

Questions are loaded as plaintext, and there's a markdown renderer on 
the frontend that renders them. Will need to think a bit more for 
embeds and videos and images, because I'm not sure how to deal with them.
Static images will have to suffice for now, and maybe the same for audio/
video as well.

I don't want to save the question itself as a video or a slide, because 
that sucks. Maybe I'll need to get comfy with a presentation framework
on the frontend (reveal.js) for better results.
